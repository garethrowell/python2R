# python2R
This is a place to study Python-R interoperability.The idea here is to take advantage of some existing R tools and use them from Python. The whole process is broken down into a series of projects.

# Project 1: Manually loading some climate data into a dataframe in R and passing it to a dataframe in Pandas


# Project 2: Use the NPS Environmental Settings ToolkingR Toolkit to acquire ACIS climate data

 Use the NPS I&M Environmental Settings Toolkit in R to obtain ACIS climate data and pass the data to a Pandas dataframe.

# Project 3: Conducting some simple exploratory data analysis of climate data in Python and reporting to R Shiny

These two projects will serve as "proof-of-concept" that ACIS climate data aquisition can be automated in R and shared into the Python environment where it becomes available for ML modeling. From there, it can be passed to Shiny for end-user metrics.

# Project 4: Exploring time series climate data using Python ML

This is a separate repo.



# Notes

Install R reticulate package and try out something very simple in Python.
