# python2R
This is a place to study Python-R interoperability. The goal is to deploy Python ML models on an R shiny app server. 

Python is rich with libaries for model development while R has 1000's of stats packages. Both have good data visualization. 
But, R shiny app web services are widely available and, in some instances, its the default web deployment platform.
How far can you go with Python ML deployed to Shiny Apps?

Enter RStudio Reticulate package...
